# xkcd

<!-- badges: start -->

The `xkcd` provides an R interface to retrieve data about [xkcd comics](https://xkcd.com) from the xkcd website - and most importantly, view these comics in your plot window!

## Installation

You can install the development version of xkcd from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mschsmith/xkcd")
```

## Browsing Comics

Given a comic number the `xkcd` function retrieves a JSON object with metadata about that comic. 

```{r example}
library(xkcd)

first_comic <- xkcd(1)
first_comic
```

The most useful thing you can do with these objects is plot them, which displays the comic image in your plot window.
